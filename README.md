Solves Common Problem in Combinatorics

1. The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
•	Problem: Given a list of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.   
2. The Knapsack Problem:
•	Problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the subset of items that has the maximum total value without exceeding a given weight capacity.
3. The Graph Coloring Problem:
•	Problem: Given a graph, assign a color to each vertex such that no adjacent vertices have the same color. The goal is to use the minimum number of colors.
4. The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem:
•	Problem: Given a graph, find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once.
5. The Bin Packing Problem:
•	Problem: Given a set of items with different sizes and a set of bins with fixed capacities, determine the minimum number of bins required to pack all the items.
6. The Maximum Independent Set Problem:
•	Problem: Given a graph, find a set of vertices such that no two vertices in the set are adjacent. The goal is to find the largest possible independent set.
6. Partitions:
•	Problem: A partition of a positive integer n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. For example, the number 5 can be partitioned as 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, or 1+1+1+1+1.
